The format follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-04

### Improved
- Refactored internal name generation wiring to reduce constructor and method arity reported by SonarQube while preserving the public `NameService` API.
- Simplified embedded name and rules data models with initializer-based JSON deserialization.
- Updated internal Sashiko dependencies to the latest stable Core and Registries packages.

### Testing
- Converted untyped xUnit member data to strongly typed `TheoryData`.
- Replaced repeated inline expected arrays with shared test fixtures.
- Cleaned enum assertions and analyzer-reported test helpers.

### Notes
This patch release does not change the public API or embedded name dataset of **Sashiko.Names**. It keeps the package aligned with the repository quality gate and the latest stable Sashiko building blocks.

- Source policy for maintaining name data from public civil-registration,
  statistical, national name-list, or culturally reviewed sources
