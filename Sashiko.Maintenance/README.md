# Sashiko Maintenance Tool

The **Sashiko Maintenance Tool** is a small command‑line utility used to
maintain and regenerate embedded data for the Sashiko ecosystem.  
It provides a clean, extensible command dispatcher and a set of library‑specific
maintenance commands.

This tool is intended for contributors working on Sashiko’s internal data
registries (languages, names, etc.). It is not required at runtime by
consumers of the Sashiko libraries.

---

## 🚀 Running the Tool

From the root of the repository:

```bash
dotnet run --project src/Sashiko.Maintenance -- <category> <command>
```

Example:

```bash
dotnet run --project src/Sashiko.Maintenance -- languages update
```

---

## 🧩 Command Structure

The tool uses a simple two‑level command structure:

```Code
<category> <command>
```

### Available Categories

| Category  |	Description |
|-----------|---------------|
| `languages` |	Maintains the embedded language registry |

#### `languages` Commands
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `update`|	Downloads and regenerates the embedded languages.json file |


Example:

```bash
dotnet run --project src/Sashiko.Maintenance -- languages update
```

This command fetches the ISO 639‑3 registry, parses it, maps it to the
Sashiko language model, and writes the updated JSON file into the
`Sashiko.Languages` project.

## ✨ Architecture Overview
The maintenance tool is built around three core concepts:

### 1. Command Dispatcher
A central router that maps categories to handlers:

```csharp
internal static readonly Dictionary<string, ICommandHandler> Handlers;
```

This makes the tool easy to extend — simply register a new handler.

### 2. Command Handlers
Each category has its own handler implementing:

```csharp
public interface ICommandHandler
{
    Task DispatchAsync(string? command);
}
```

Handlers are instance‑based and support test hooks for full isolation.

### 3. Library‑Specific Maintenance Logic
Each library (e.g., `Sashiko.Languages`) exposes a maintenance entry point:

```csharp
LanguageRegistryMaintenance.UpdateEmbeddedLanguagesAsync();
```

This keeps the dispatcher clean and the responsibilities well‑separated.

---

## 🧪 Testing
The maintenance tool is fully covered by a lightweight but meaningful test suite:

- Command routing
- Handler invocation
- Help and error output
- Deterministic update behavior
- File generation logic
- Project root discovery

Console output is captured safely using `Console.SetOut` with proper restoration
to avoid global state pollution.

Parallel test execution is disabled for command‑related tests to ensure
deterministic behavior.

---

## ➕ Extending the Tool
To add a new category:

1. Create a new handler implementing `ICommandHandler`

2. Register it in `CommandDispatcher.Handlers`

3. Add tests for routing and handler behavior

4. Add documentation to this README

Example:

```csharp
Handlers["cultures"] = new CultureCommandHandler();
```
