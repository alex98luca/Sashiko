# Changelog — Sashiko Maintenance Tool

This changelog tracks meaningful changes to the internal maintenance tool used
across the Sashiko ecosystem.  
It is intended for contributors.  
The maintenance tool is not versioned or published as a NuGet package.

### Improved
- Resolved SonarQube/Roslyn findings in the maintenance entry point, language updater, name pool polisher, and command tests.
- Made required ISO 639-3 normalization explicit when mapping SIL language rows.
- Reworked the ISO 639-3 download endpoint construction to avoid hardcoded absolute URI literals.
- Tightened name pool polishing helpers and test fixtures for clearer analyzer behavior.

### Testing
- Added assertions to no-hook command handler tests.
- Replaced repeated inline test arrays with shared fixtures.
- Kept command-dispatch and name-polishing tests deterministic and isolated.

### Documentation
- Documented the names maintenance workflow that was introduced after the original maintenance tool changelog entry.

### Added
- `names polish` command for maintaining embedded `Sashiko.Names` data.
- `NamePoolPolisher` for trimming, sorting, and deduplicating every embedded `names.json` file.
- `NamePoolMaintenance` entry point for locating and polishing the `Sashiko.Names/Data` folder.
- Tests covering names command dispatch and name pool polishing behavior.

### Notes
- Names maintenance keeps embedded data contributor-friendly without adding runtime dependencies to `Sashiko.Names`.
